## Brief Description


This folder contains two input files (mol.config, geom.dat) of C6H3F3 molecule, where ab-initio calculation has been done with MOLPRO. 
The output files corresponding to optimized geometry (equigeom.dat), wilson (wilson.dat) and frequency files(frequency.dat) calculated by this program package. 
Geometry optimization and frequency calculation has been performed at MP2 method with cc-pvDZ basis set.
