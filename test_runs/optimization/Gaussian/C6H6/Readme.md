## Brief Description


This folder contains two input files (mol.config, geom.dat) of C6H6 molecule, where ab-initio calculation has been done with Gaussian. 
The output files corresponding to optimized geometry (equigeom.dat), wilson (wilson.dat) and frequency files(frequency.dat) calculated by this program package. 
Geometry optimization and frequency calculation has been performed at DFT/B3LYP method with cc-pvDZ basis set.
