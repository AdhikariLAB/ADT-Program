## Brief Description


This folder contains two input files (mol.config, geom.dat) of NO2 radical, where ab-initio calculation has been done with Gaussian. 
The output files corresponding to optimized geometry (equigeom.dat), wilson (wilson.dat) and frequency files(frequency.dat) calculated by this program package. 
Geometry optimization and frequency calculation has been performed at UCCSD method with cc-pvDZ basis set.

## Command:

The following command is used to generate the results, which are stored in this folder.


>`adt opt -gauss -config gauss.config`
