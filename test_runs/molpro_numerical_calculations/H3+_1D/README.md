## Description


This folder contains two input files (molpro.config, atomfile.dat) of H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>, and the output files corresponding to
ADT quantities (ADT angles, residue of ADT angles, ADT matrices and diabatic potential energy matrices) calculated by this 
program package. For 1D ADT calculation of H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>, we employ Jacobi coordinate system, where &r;, &R;, &gamma; and &q; 
are chosen as 2 Bohr, 1.732050808 Bohr, 90<sup>o</sup> and 0.5 Bohr, respectively. We use other coordinate, &phi; to compute *ab initio* 
adiabatic potential energy surfaces (PESs) for three lowest electronic states and nonadiabatic coupling terms (NACTs) within them. 
The adiabatic potential energies are calculated in multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) level implementing Dunningâ€™s correlation 
consistent quintuple zeta (cc-pV5Z) basis set and 2 electrons in 11 orbitals (2e, 11o) configuration active space (CAS). NACTs are computed 
using coupled-perturbed multi-configuration space self-consistent field (CP-MCSCF) method implemented in MOLPRO quantum chemistry software. 
The circular coordinate, &phi; spans from 0 to 2&pi; such that total number of grid points wil be 121. Integration is performed along this 
circular coordinate and simple text format is used for output.
